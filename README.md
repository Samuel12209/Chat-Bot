# Machine learning Bot |Status: FUNCTIONAL!
This is Machine learning! I wanted to make an AI so im doing machine learning
drop the files into your IDE and go!

There is also discord integration with this if you run the discord machine learning file instead of machine learning
machine learning is for chatting in your ide, the discord version is for a server perhaps

You can train this bow however you like and adjust its responses in brain.json
it will grab the most accurate awnser and respond to your questions depending on the responses you made
feel free to adjust the accuracy more and more to get good responses

This is my progress through making Machine learning!
